/**
 * Examples of advanced <em>implementation-specific</em> functionality from the Core Client. 
 * Features which are useful enough for production but whose API is not yet sufficiently polished to
 * be promoted to the Core API (or higher-level APIs) are sometimes added to the Core Client 
 * (typically to the KB or Query Client modules). These features can be called from the Core Client
 * when necessary, but direct calls to the Core Client implementation (or any implementation) should
 * be avoided whenever possible.
