===========================

For more information, visit the [Cyc Developer Center](http://dev.cyc.com/).

**Important note about _backwards-compatibility:_** It is expected that more Core API release 
candidates will follow. Until the final 1.0.0 release, it is expected that future release candidates
will break backwards compatibility.


1.0.0-rc4 - 2015-10-29
----------------------
Examples updated to work 
against [Cyc Core API Suite 1.0.0-rc4](https://github.com/cycorp/api-suite/releases/tag/core-api-suite-1.0.0-rc4) and a
[suitable version of Cyc](https://github.com/cycorp/example-code/blob/core-api-use-cases-1.0.0-rc4/cyc-core-use-cases/README.md#requirements).
Note that 1.0.0-rc4 is _not backwards-compatible_ with earlier releases.


1.0.0-rc3 - 2015-08-14
----------------------

[suitable version of Cyc](https://github.com/cycorp/example-code/blob/core-api-use-cases-1.0.0-rc3/README.md#requirements).
